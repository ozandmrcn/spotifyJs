The **spotifyJs** project provides a music streaming experience similar to Spotify. It integrates with the Shazam API to fetch music data and allows users to search for songs and play them. Upon opening the app, users are greeted with popular tracks. A small animation is added while playing music, where the album cover rotates, just like in Spotify.
